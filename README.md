# Grrr development guidelines
Our guidelines and best practices for development and everything around it.


## Mantras
- We start developing when there is a clear scope.
- We strive for test-driven development.
- We work in small, feature-based iterations.
- We code to the best of our abilities, according to our [coding standards](coding-standards/README.md).
- We version our files with [Git](git/README.md).
- We [deploy](deployment/README.md) our work to publish it to the world.
- We set up our [servers](server/README.md) to run as smoothly as possible.
- We [monitor](monitoring/README.md) our work to make sure everything keeps running.
