# Git branches

## One Flow

We use the [One Flow](http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) model for organizing branches. There's but a single long-running branch, `master`.
From there we branch off to create _feature_ branches and _hotfix_ branches. We use git tags extensively to mark deployable commits. 

Hotfixes usually increment the patch point of the current version they branched from, AKA they go from `3.12.1` to `3.12.2`.  
Releases made from `master` increase either the minor or the major point, depending on their nature, for instance from `3.12.2` to `3.13.0`.

The following two aliases might help to get the system right.  
The `hotfix` one especially helps to not forget to branch off a point in the past when creating a hotfix branch.

```
[alias]
  feature = "!f() { git checkout -b 'feature/'$(git config user.name | cut -d' ' -f1 | awk '{print tolower($0)}')'-'$1; }; f"
  hotfix = "!f() { [ x$# != x2 ]&&echo "Two arguments required!" >&2 || git checkout -b 'hotfix/'$(git config user.name | cut -d' ' -f1 | awk '{print tolower($0)}')'-'$1 $2; }; f"

```

Note that we like to prefix branches using the name of the author, to see at a glance who to ask about branches.


## Pulling changes

Whenever you have local commits, but the remote also includes new work, you have diverged.

When doing a regular `git pull` you will be dropped into your editor to create a merge commit. 

- ABORT immediately. Clear out the commit message and quit your editor. 
- Use `git merge --abort` to discard your merge state.
- Use `git pull --rebase` instead to pull changes but avoid the noise of a merge commit.

## Lifecycle of a feature branch

- Start the feature: `git checkout -b my-feature`
- Do your commits.
- Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes.
  - `git fetch origin`
  - `git rebase origin/master`
- Push to the remote: `git push -u origin my-feature`
- Create a Pull Request on Github.
- When the PR has been approved, use interactive rebasing to clean up your history (see **Cleaning up your branch **below).
- Merge the PR and delete the branch, preferably using Github's **Rebase and Merge** option, in order to avoid the noise of a merge commit.

## Lifecycle of a hotfix branch

It's exactly the same as starting a feature, with the notable difference you will want to fork from some previously released version.

Let's say the current production version is tagged `1.50.4` and you've found a critical bug. 

- Create a hotfix branch, branched off the previous production version: `git checkout -b my-fix 1.50.4`
- Do your commits as usual.
- Push to the remote: `git push -u origin my-fix`
- Create a Pull Request on Github. Mention this is a hotfix.
- When the PR has been approved, tag your HEAD: `git tag 1.50.5`
- Merge the branch, either on Github or on the CLI, but make sure to use a regular merge, with a commit: `git merge my-fix`
- Push the tag: `git push origin --tags`
- If applicable, remove the remote branch: `git push origin :my-fix`
- Push `master`: `git push origin master`

You can now deploy the new tag to production.

## Accidentally created a feature instead of a hotfix?

`git rebase` is here to rescue you. With `git rebase --onto` you can rebase your feature branch onto a released tag, which makes it a hotfix.

To make it visual this is your situation:

```
   o---o---o---o---o  v1.0.0-release
	\
	 o---o---o---o---o  master
			  \
			   o---o---o  feature/branch
```

After running `git rebase --onto v1.0.0-release master feature/branch` you get this structure:

```
   o---o---o---o---o  v1.0.0-release
       |            \
       |             o'--o'--o'  feature/branch
	\
	 o---o---o---o---o  master

```

Changing the branch name will result in a new PR on GitHub. When that's not desired you have to leave the branch name like this. Adding a clear commit in the PR will do.

`git help rebase` and [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) contain more examples covering `--onto`.  

## Rebasing

- You're working on a feature branch
- Meanwhile, master has been updated and you wish to include the changes in your branch
- Go back to master: `git checkout master`
- Pull master to make sure you're up-to-date: `git pull origin master`
- Return to the feature branch: `git checkout my-feature`
- `git rebase master`
- If there are conflicts, resolve them and use: 
  - `git add .` But don't commit!
  - `git rebase --continue`
- If there's a remote tracking your branch, use `git push --force-with-lease`. Only force-push if you're sure there's nobody else working on the same branch!
- Note: git will complain about being diverged every time you change history (whenever you amend a commit or rebase a branch). It will suggest you should pull then push, but DO NOT PULL. It's YOUR feature branch, you know nobody else has worked on it. If not, you shouldn't be changing history.

## Cleaning up your branch

ðŸ’¡ Pro-tip: grab the `rbi` git alias to drop into interactive rebase starting at the first commit of your branch: [https://github.com/harmenjanssen/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig](https://github.com/harmenjanssen/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig)

For example `git rbi master` would find the commit where you branched off `master` and allows you to rebase all commits from that point on.

Git will drop you into your configured editor where it will list the commits within the specified range.

By default all will be prefixed with the word `pick`. If you would leave this alone and simply save and quit the file, everything would stay the same. 

You can, however, use various other keywords to change the history of your branch:

`pick` = use commit

`reword` = use commit, but edit the commit message

`edit` = use commit, but stop for amending

`squash` = use commit, but meld into previous commit

`fixup` = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message

`exec` = run command (the rest of the line) using shell

`drop` = remove commit

After saving the file Git will replay or drop your commits and/or smoosh 'm together like you instructed. When using `squash` or `reword` you will be prompted to come up with a new commit message.

Note: see the general advice above in the **Rebasing** section about force-pushing et cetera.

Note: you can swap the order of commits by simply reordering them in the rebase file.

Note: if you want to edit a commit message, you have to choose `reword`. Changing the commit message directly in the rebase file won't work. You will be prompted for a new message after saving the rebase file.
